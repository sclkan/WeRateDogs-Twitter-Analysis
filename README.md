# WeRateDogs (Twitter) Data Wrangling and Analysis
WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a comical twist. We will be wrangling data from this “puppular” account and transform them into useful analyses and visualizations.

We will first obtain raw data via the Twitter API and assess them for quality and tidiness issues. We will then define all the necessary cleaning tasks and convert them to actual codes. Finally, we will use the resulted output for exploratory data analysis to gain key insights.
